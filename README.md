2. **Create database**
```CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";  --auto-generate UUID for primary key

-- Create Applicant table
CREATE TABLE Applicant (
 applicant_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(), --UUID as PK
 applicant_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
 contact_number VARCHAR(15),
 email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
 address VARCHAR(255),
 resume VARCHAR(250), -- resume file name
 role_applied UUID NOT NULL,   -- FK to job_id
 personality_type VARCHAR(50),
 status VARCHAR(20), -- 'Reviewing', 'Shortlisted', 'Rejected'
 personality_test_score TEXT,
 compatibility_score INT CHECK (compatibility_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
 updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 compatibility_breakdown TEXT
);

-- Add foreign key constraint for role_applied referencing job(job_id)
ALTER TABLE Applicant
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_role_applied
FOREIGN KEY (role_applied) REFERENCES job(job_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Create Job table
CREATE TABLE Job (
   job_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),        -- UUID PK
   job VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,                                  -- job title e.g. "Software Engineer"
   job_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Full-time'
      CHECK (job_type IN ('Full-time', 'Part-time', 'Intern')), -- job type
   experience VARCHAR(100),                                   -- e.g. "2 years", "None"
   education VARCHAR(100),                                    -- e.g. "Degree in Computer Science"
   requirement TEXT,                                          -- general requirements
   description TEXT,                                          -- detailed job description
   status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'active',                       -- job status (active, draft, closed)
   created_by UUID,                                           -- FK to admin_id
   updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   CONSTRAINT fk_job_created_by
      FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES admin(admin_id)
      ON DELETE SET NULL
      ON UPDATE CASCADE
   );

   -- Create Admin table
   CREATE TABLE Admin (
   admin_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),   -- UUID as PK
   name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
   password VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL,                        -- store a hashed password, not plain text
   role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL                              -- e.g. HR Manager, Hiring Manager
   );

   -- Add in sample data to log in hiring system
   -- Insert sample Admin
   INSERT INTO admin (name, email, password, role) VALUES
   ('Alice Tan', 'alice@company.com', '123', 'Hiring Manager'),
   ('Bob Lee', 'bob@company.com', '123', 'IT Manager');
   ```

1. **Create environment variables** by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   RESUME_UPLOAD_PATH="C://path//to//store//resume"
   ```
